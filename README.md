# Jupyter As A MarkUp

Attempt to beautifully push EDA documents directly to docs.corca.ai for better accessability & searchability, using React, Jupyter, Python and Gatsby.


# Use of Python, Jupyter and Gatsby

Please do not attempt to inject any python dependencies into this project. Jupyter notebooks will be viwed 'as is' and will not be run.

It is best to run your project in your own virtual environment, and copy the ipynb content into the project & Build.
